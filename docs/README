Originally Assimp is compiled as a dynamic library with CMake.

The Cinder-Assimp block has a statically compiled version included.
The static library can be recompiled with the following steps:

Download Assimp from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/assimp/files/assimp-2.0/assimp--2.0.863-sdk.zip/download

unzip assimp--2.0.863-sdk
cd assimp--2.0.863-sdk 
patch -p1 <assimp-static.patch
cmake -D ENABLE_BOOST_WORKAROUND=ON -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fvisibility-inlines-hidden" .
cd code
make

which should create libassimp.a in the current directory.
